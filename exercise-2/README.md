# Exercise-2
In this exercise, you'll practice using the [New York Times API](https://developer.nytimes.com/) to fetch movie reviews. To learn more about the API, see the [developer console](https://developer.nytimes.com/movie_reviews_v2.json). You'll also need to **register for an API key** that can access there movie reviews API by following [this link](https://developer.nytimes.com/signup).

You should create a file called `api-key.R`, and read it into your `exercise.R` script using the `source()` function. Make sure to add `api-key.R` to your `.gitignore` file (at the root of the chapter repository) so that you **keep your key private**. 

As in previous exercises, you should fork and clone this repository, follow the instructions in `exercise.R` file, then `add` and `commit` your changes so that you can `push` them back up to Github.
