# Exercise-1
In this exercise, you'll practice reading the API of and requesting data from the GitHub API (see the somewhat dense [documentation](https://developer.github.com/v3/)). 

As in previous exercises, you should fork and clone this repository, follow the instructions in `exercise.R` file, then `add` and `commit` your changes so that you can `push` them back up to Github.
